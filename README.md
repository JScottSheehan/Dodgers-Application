In this repository I have included a coding sample from a project I worked on for a Python class at General Assembly in 2018.  The goal of the project was to show what we had learned in the course.  The project I came up with was using MLB statistics from 1998-2017 to find variables correlated to wins.  Then, using these variables predict the number of games each team will win for the whole season based on how they have performed over the first two months.  The model predicted the top teams to be the Yankees, Cubs, Astros, and Red Sox, which was almost true with the Yankees, Astros, and Red Sox being the top three teams and the Cubs narrowly finishing behind the A's and Brewers (after a 163rd game).
